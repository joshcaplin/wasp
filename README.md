# Wasp
Wasp is a simple wrapper around the [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) library to provide drag & drop capabilities for a vertical list.  This component allows you to reuse the same functionality across multiple apps without needing to duplicate logic, styling, etc.  Follow the directions below and you'll have drag & drop functionality set up in less than 5 minutes!
